This repository holds the code used to produce simulations and data analysis
for “Differences in Set-Based Tests for Sparse Alternatives when Testing Sets of 
Outcomes Compared to Sets of Explanatory Factors in Genetic Association Studies”
by Ryan Sun, Andy Shi, and Xihong Lin.

Note that the genetic data we used in analysis is restricted for privacy reasons and
cannot be shared in this venue. For this reason, some files have the word SCRAMBLED
appended to the end. This designation means that the results are NOT the original
versions used to write our manuscript, they are instead randomized placeholders.
Once permission is obtained from the relevant data owners, substituting the real
data for the scrambled data will reproduce what is reported in the manuscript.
